# 🌐 Azure Fullstack Terraform Project  

A robust and scalable infrastructure deployment on **Microsoft Azure** using **Terraform**.  
This project follows *Infrastructure as Code (IaC)* best practices to deploy a **fullstack application** with separate **frontend** and **backend VMs**, designed for **security**, **modularity**, and **easy maintenance**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview  

- 🧩 Developed modular Terraform code to provision Azure resources efficiently.  
- 🔄 Segregated environments (**Dev & Prod**) to support smooth development lifecycle and risk reduction.  
- 🛡️ Applied Azure best practices: subnet isolation, **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**, and static public IPs.  
- ♻️ Created reusable modules for **Resource Groups**, **Virtual Networks**, **Subnets**, **NICs**, **NSGs**, and **VMs** to ensure scalability and maintainability.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features  

- **🧱 Modular Architecture:** Reusable Terraform modules for fast and consistent environment setup.  
- **🔐 Environment Isolation:** Separate state management for Dev and Prod using **Azure Blob Storage backend**.  
- **🌐 Secure Network Design:** Frontend and backend subnets with NSGs restricting SSH to backend and HTTP access open on frontend.  
- **🤖 Automation Ready:** Clear workflow to initialize, plan, and apply Terraform for reliable deployments.  
- **📡 Output Management:** Automatic retrieval of VM public IPs for easy SSH access and application deployment.
